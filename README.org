#+TITLE: My Dotfiles
This is a repo for my dotfiles. I currently only have qtile and bash configured here, but I have a seperate repo ([[https:github.com/dwdwdan/.emacs.gnu][dwdwdan/.emacs.gnu]]) for my emacs configuration. The repo is designed to be installed with GNU Stow, so if you have that installed you should be able to run

#+begin_example
$ stow --target=$HOME .
#+end_example

from inside the repository. It may throw errors if your existing dotfiles have the same name (which will probably be the case). In this case, simply delete/rename the ones that currently exist and run the command again.

* TODOs
** TODO Fix KDE Connect Slideshow Pointer
At the moment, if a window isn't full screen, the slideshow pointer acts as if it were a tiling window, meaning only half the screen is used.
